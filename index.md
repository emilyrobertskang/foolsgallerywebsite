### Premise

You are a member of an elite group of fools. Your goal is to have your art collection displayed in the world-renouned Fool's Gallery. 

A band of international forgers have been creating fake paintings and circulating them into the local art market. One expert predicts that 50% of the art in the town is forged; some of these forgeries could be in your very own collection! Luckily a benevolent museum curator has developed a new method to detect fakes. 

Do you want the fame and glory that comes with being an benefactor of the Fool's Gallery? Is this more important to you than having authentic art in the gallery? Good forgers are very talented artists too afterall...

### About Fool's Gallery

Fool's Gallery was first imagined by Andrew Kang in 2020 during COVID-19 social distancing. After months of losing to Emily at board games, card games, and chess, he decided to create his own board game, one that he could actually win... 

Emily was not satifisfied to sit idly by and let Andrew have all the fun, plus he needed her technical prowess to create a website and QR codes for the game, so she agreed to help, for a 54% stake in the company.

### FAQ's

Q: Why didn't you include X collection, artist, or artwork?
A: Neither of us have a background in art or art history other than amatuer appreciation so we probably just don't know about it. We found all the images for our game by simply scrolling through museum databases and finding art we like.

Q: Where did you find the artwork used in the game?
A: Public domain and Creative Commons collections on websites including but not limited to:
- Wikimedia: https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page 
- Art Institute of Chicago: https://www.artic.edu/collection?is_public_domain=1 
- The Met Museum: https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection 
- Smithsonian Open Access: https://www.si.edu/openaccess 
- National Gallery of Art: https://www.nga.gov/open-access-images.html
