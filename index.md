### About Fool's Gallery

Fool's Gallery was first imagined by Andrew Kang in 2020 during COVID-19 social distancing. After months of losing to Emily at board games, card games, and chess, he decided to create his own board game, one that he could actually win... 

Emily was not satifisfied to sit idly by and let Andrew have all the fun, plus he needed her technical prowess to create a website and QR codes for the game, so she agreed to help, for a 53% stake in the company.
